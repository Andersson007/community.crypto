minor_changes:
  - "get_certificate - allow to obtain the certificate chain sent by the server, and the one used for validation, with the new ``get_certificate_chain`` option.
     Note that this option only works if the module is run with Python 3.10 or newer
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/568, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/784)."
